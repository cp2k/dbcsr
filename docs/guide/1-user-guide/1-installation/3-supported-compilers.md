title: Supported Compilers

# Supported compilers

DBCSR uses the Fortran 2008+ standard, which requires up-to-date compilers.
Currently direct testing is done with the following compilers:

* GNU 5.4.0, 8.3.0
* Intel 19.0.1.144

Since DBCSR is a core library of CP2K, the code gets additional testing on a
wider range of systems and compilers, you can find more information about this
on [CP2K Compiler Support](https://www.cp2k.org/dev:compiler_support).
