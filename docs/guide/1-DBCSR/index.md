# DBCSR

DBCSR is a sparse matrix library designed to efficiently perform sparse matrix-matrix multiplication, among other operations. It is MPI and OpenMP parallel, and can exploit accelerators.

DBCSR was developed as a part of [CP2K](https://github.com/cp2k/cp2k/), where it provides core functionality for [linear scaling electronic structure theory](https://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fct200897x). It is now released as a standalone library for integration in other projects.
