--------------------

DBCSR stands for **D**istributed **B**locked **C**ompressed **S**parse **R**ow.

DBCSR is a library designed to efficiently perform sparse matrix-matrix multiplication, among other operations.

It is MPI and OpenMP parallel and can exploit Nvidia and AMD GPUs via CUDA and HIP.

To get started with DBCSR, go to

- [Installation Guide](page/1-user-guide/1-installation/1-install.html)
- [User guide](page/1-user-guide/index.html)
- [Developer guide](page/2-developer-guide/index.html)
